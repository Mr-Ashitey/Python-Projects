The Fibonacci sequence was first found by an Italian named Leonardo Pisano Bogollo (Fibonacci).
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, ...

The Fibonacci formula is given as, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, where n > 1.

The Fibonacci sequence, in simple terms, says that every number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of two numbers preceding it in the sequence.
the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!
